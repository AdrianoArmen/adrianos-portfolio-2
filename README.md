## Description

This sample website was designed to showcase my advanced CSS skills along with structural knowledge on how to set up a single-page application. This project also references my problem-solving skills using online resources to investigate and deploy real-time design ideas into my website. By using only HTML5 and CSS3 I have created a simple professional portfolio in which I will display all my upcoming projects. I procured a bold style different from the mockup to enhance its unique appearance. I was able to investigate a number of styling techniques to make the navigation bar adapt to the viewer screen size. I used media queries to make this project a responsive web design example.
